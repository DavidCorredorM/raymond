# Roadmap — deferred base-package work

Decisions and gaps that apply to Raymond generically, deferred rather than
lost. Not Angela-specific — anything about her vault's content or her
SIGRA skills lives in her deployment, not here.

## 5. Git remote for the vault

Right now a vault's git history lives only on the machine it was created
on. A disk failure loses all of it — notes and history both. Needs:

- Decide the default: does the bootstrap script prompt for a remote, or
  is this left entirely to the user?
- Document the private-repo requirement prominently — a vault is
  personal notes by default.
- Consider whether the panel should surface "no remote configured" as a
  visible warning, since a silent gap here is the dangerous kind.

## 6. Backup, distinct from git

Git is version control, not backup — it doesn't protect against the
machine itself dying, and a sync mechanism (once phase 2 picks one)
propagates deletions and corruption exactly as faithfully as edits.
Needs a real off-box target and schedule. `restic` was the working
assumption in `01-decisions.md`; not yet designed or scripted.

## 7. Dashboards-as-files spec, agent inbox, proposal/approve flow

The architectural principle is settled (see `panel/README.md`): a
dashboard is a file with a frontmatter widget spec, an agent adds a todo
or a message by writing a file, nothing lives only in the app's memory.

**Partially designed now** — `panel/docs/frontend-implementation-plan.md`
§5 specifies the widget spec (`query`, `stale`, `count`, `vault-health`,
`backlinks`, plus a phase-4 `actions` kind), with worked YAML examples,
and reasons through why it's a flat filter object rather than a query
language (this app has no auth in front of it — a query language is
arbitrary power handed to anything that can write a file).

Still not designed:

- Where the agent's proposals land before a human approves them —
  `inbox/` vs a git branch, and what the panel does with either
- The approve/reject UI and what "reject" does to the underlying file
- Conflict resolution — the plan explicitly leaves this out of phase 1;
  writes are full-file overwrites with no ETag, so two tabs editing the
  same note will clobber each other
